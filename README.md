# uDrop

## What's this? 🤔

```uDrop``` was born as private C# project, under the name of ```uPatcher``` in mid-2022, after the ```Vanced Team``` closure.

Its main goal was (and still is) to create a modded YouTube app, based on my personal vision with a few, yet essential, mods (some of which were also developed by me), in order to make the app decently usable. In practice: the stock version that never was. 😁

```uDrop``` follows the old philosophy of the ```Vanced Team``` to build their mods: with a dedicated C# project.

In the end, ```uDrop``` doesn't want to compete with ReVanced (it wouldn't be possible in any case, due to its different operating mechanisms).  
```uDrop``` simply aims to be an Open Source tribute to the past work of the ```Vanced Team``` (and, above all, a personal patcher I can use to test new YouTube beta versions with minimal effort).

## Notes 📒

1) Before using the modded YouTube client, make sure to install MicroG from the [ReVanced Team repository](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases).
   This is the only version of MicroG which I have personally tested and that doesn't cause any problem related to poor performance or battery drain (at least on my devices). 

2) This project was originally designed to remain private, and has therefore has always remained without documentation... uDrop will likely never get documentation, because my free time only allows me to work on the mods code.
